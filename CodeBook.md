Data definition of course project
=============
# subject
a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years
1 to 30 refers to volunteer number repectively
# activity
six activities volunteer does with a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist
* 1 WALKING
* 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* 4 SITTING
* 5 STANDING
* 6 LAYING
# variable
There are in total 86 variables included with a few tail letters indication if it is mean or standard deviation of a certain 
measurement. 
All measurements are devided into 3 groups:
* body and gravity accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals represented by tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ
* Jerk signals derived by the body linear acceleration and angular velocity in time, represented by tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
* Euclidean norm of Jerk signals represented by tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag
* Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
# mean_value
mean value of all variables by subject and activity
